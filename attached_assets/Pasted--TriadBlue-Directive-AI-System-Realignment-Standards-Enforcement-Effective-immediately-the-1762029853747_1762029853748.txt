## 🚀 TriadBlue Directive: AI System Realignment & Standards Enforcement

Effective immediately, the following updates are active:

1. The **AI Operations Charter** (v1.0) is now official.  
   - Rune (Architect) maintains the standards.  
   - Axel (Agent) executes and audits code.  
   - Lumen (Assistant) handles documentation and communication.  
   - Cyen (Coach) remains client-facing only.

2. The **Architect (Rune)** and **Agent (Axel)** are to:
   - Review every markdown file (`README.md`, `REPLIT.md`, `STATUS_REPORT.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `_CONSTANTS.md`, `TRIAD_BLUE_STANDARDS.md`) for alignment.  
   - Correct all formatting, naming, color, and consistency violations across files.  
   - Verify constants and architecture integrity based on the current `_constants.md` and `architecture.md`.  
   - Document every change in `STATUS_REPORT.md` with commit trace.

3. The **Assistant (Lumen)** is to:
   - Restore clarity and consistency to all documentation once Rune and Axel have finished their audit.  
   - Eliminate redundant or contradictory phrasing.  
   - Rebuild internal structure and tables for legibility **without changing meaning or tone**.  
   - Confirm all references and section anchors are accurate.

4. The **Architect (Rune)** has final authority for standards and structure.
   - Any disputes or inconsistencies must be logged under “Notes” in `STATUS_REPORT.md`.

5. Goal of this operation:
   - Achieve **100% consistency** across documentation and source code.
   - Eliminate all legacy conflicts introduced by prior Assistant iterations.
   - Validate that every document references only approved values and terminology.

6. Deliverables:
   - Updated versions of all affected `.md` files.  
   - GitHub Issues logged for each change category.  
   - Final sign-off commit message:  
     `"[Rune + Axel] TriadBlue Standards Alignment v1.0 — Verified"`
