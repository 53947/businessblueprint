## Asset Management (MANDATORY)

**All TriadBlue ecosystem applications MUST include asset upload functionality from day one.**

- Build upload interface in dashboard for favicon and company logos
- Implement backend API with file validation (PNG/SVG/ICO/WEBP, max 2MB)
- Store assets in database with metadata tracking
- Enable dynamic favicon injection (no hardcoded favicon in HTML)
- Support logo management in headers/widgets via API

**Reference**: See ASSET_MANAGEMENT_STANDARDS.md for complete implementation guide.

**Non-negotiable**: Projects without asset upload capability are incomplete.
