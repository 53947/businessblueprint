1. Official Developer Documentation (Vendor / Business-Center APIs)

From the Vendasta Developer Center and the Appspot-hosted Business Center API documentation, here are key endpoints commonly used by white-label partners (i.e., agencies or resellers using Vendasta APIs to build custom branded workflows):

Business-Center API Endpoints

These are foundational REST endpoints for managing accounts, users, product associations—crucial for white-label integrations:

2. Branding & White-Labeling Context

While the above endpoints are essential for implementing white-label features, Vendasta supports white-labeling more broadly via these configuration layers:
	•	In documentation “White‑labeling & Branding” (Developer Center), Vendasta highlights branding capabilities like customizing dashboard colors, logos, and using the Account API to manage white-labeled experiences.  ￼ ￼
	•	The Support guide “Getting Started Guide: Set up and white label the platform” explains domain and email customization, white-label branding of products, customizing Business App UX—these are UI-level settings, not necessarily API endpoints but critical for white-label partners.  ￼
