✅ Implementation Instructions (keep this high-level & safe)

Wrap the desktop text for the steps in a container that is:

Visible on desktop / larger screens

Hidden on mobile

Create a second container with the mobile text above, with:

Visible on mobile

Hidden on desktop / larger screens

You may use your existing responsive utility classes (for example, something like):

mobile-only vs desktop-only

or hidden md:block and block md:hidden

or any equivalent pattern already used in this project

Do not change:

HTML hierarchy of the existing desktop block

Any classes used for styling

Any spacing, margins, or layout for the section

Any wording I’ve given you here

Your only structural change should be:

A second text block for mobile

Show/hide logic via responsive classes

Acknowledge with:
“Confirmed — I will only add responsive show/hide structure and mobile text, and will not change anything else.”
