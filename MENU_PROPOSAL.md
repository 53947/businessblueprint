## Issues with Current Menu

Based on docs/_constants.md and TRIAD_BLUE_STANDARDS.md:

1. ✅ **Applications** - Correct (shows all 4 Commverse apps)
2. ✅ **Pricing** - Correct (has Marketplace as submenu, not top-level)
3. ❓ **Solutions** - Structure may need clarification
4. ❓ **Resources** - Structure may need clarification

## What Information Do You Want in the Menu?

You mentioned you sent menu info earlier showing "what we really do" - I need to see that information to create the proper proposal.

**Please provide:**

1. What should be under "Solutions" menu?
2. What should be under "Resources" menu?
3. Are there other top-level menu items needed?
4. What descriptions/features should appear for each menu item?
